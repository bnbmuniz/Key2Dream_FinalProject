# This is the final project for Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
# It's a website where anyone can where anyone can talk about their dreams and it will turn into a painting! 
# I used Python throughout this project.
# I used deep learning models: Clip (Aphantasia Github Repo - https://github.com/eps696/aphantasia) 
# and HuggingFace NLP models.
# I finally used Flask to create the website.
# The examples of paintings were made from friendsâ€™ dreams and dataset from the Dreampire website (https://www.dreampire.com/).
